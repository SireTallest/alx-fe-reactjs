# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# ALX React Application ⚛️

## Description
A modern, high-performance web application foundation built using **React 19** and **Vite**. This project serves as a streamlined boilerplate designed for rapid frontend development, featuring lightning-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR), a modular component structure, and strict linting configurations to ensure production-grade code quality.

## Features
- **Next-Gen Tooling**: Leverages Vite for near-instant server starts and optimized builds.
- **Modern React**: Utilizes React 19 features and functional components with Hooks.
- **Optimized Styles**: Implements responsive CSS with support for dark/light system preferences.
- **Code Integrity**: Pre-configured ESLint rules to maintain consistent coding standards across the repository.
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns between components, assets, and styling.

## Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose | Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| React 19 | UI Library | [react.dev](https://react.dev/) |
| Vite | Build Tool & Dev Server | [vite.dev](https://vite.dev/) |
| ESLint | Static Code Analysis | [eslint.org](https://eslint.org/) |
| JavaScript (ES6+) | Scripting Language | [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/) |

## Getting Started

### Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SireTallest/alx-fe-reactjs.git
   cd alx-react-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Usage
Once the development server is running, the application is accessible at `http://localhost:5173`. 

- **State Management**: The main counter functionality in `App.jsx` demonstrates basic React `useState` hooks.
- **Development**: Edit any file in the `src` directory, and the browser will reflect changes instantly via Vite's HMR.
- **Linting**: Run `npm run lint` to check for syntax errors or stylistic inconsistencies before committing code.
