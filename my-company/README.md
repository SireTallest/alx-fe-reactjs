# MyCompany Corporate Portal 🏢

## Description
A high-performance, modern web application built with **React 19** and **Vite**. This project serves as a structured foundation for a corporate website, featuring a component-based architecture and client-side routing. It is optimized for speed, maintainability, and a seamless user experience.

## Features
* 🚀 **Vite-Powered Development**: Utilizes the latest build tools for near-instant Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
* 🧩 **Modular Architecture**: Organized component structure (Home, About, Services, Contact) for clear separation of concerns.
* 🛣️ **Client-Side Routing**: Integrated with `react-router-dom` for fluid navigation without page reloads.
* 🛠️ **Strict Standards**: Pre-configured with ESLint to maintain high code quality and consistency across the codebase.
* 🎨 **Modern Styling**: Baseline CSS setup including responsive design principles and system-ui font stacks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your local machine.

### Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

* 📥 **Clone the Repository**:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SireTallest/alx-fe-reactjs.git
  ```

* 📂 **Navigate to Project Directory**:
  ```bash
  cd my-company
  ```

* 📦 **Install Dependencies**:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

* ▶️ **Start Development Server**:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Usage
Once the development server is running, you can explore the following:

1. **Main Navigation**: Use the internal routing logic to switch between the Home, About, Services, and Contact views.
2. **Interactive Elements**: The `App.jsx` entry point contains a functional counter component demonstrating React's state management.
3. **Production Build**: To generate a minified, production-ready bundle, execute:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
