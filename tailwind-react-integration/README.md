# Modern React Starter with Tailwind CSS and Vite ⚛️

## Overview
This project provides a robust and streamlined starter template for building modern web applications using React 18, integrated seamlessly with Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development, all powered by Vite for an incredibly fast development experience. It's designed to get you up and running with a powerful, modern frontend stack with minimal configuration.

## Features
- **React 18**: Leverage the latest features of React for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Utility-first CSS framework for quickly designing responsive and custom UIs directly in your markup.
- **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling that offers lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized builds.
- **ESLint**: Configured with recommended rules for React and React Hooks to ensure code quality and consistency.
- **Modern Module Setup**: Uses ES Modules for a cleaner, more efficient codebase.
- **Optimized for Development**: Pre-configured scripts for development, building, and linting.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SireTallest/alx-fe-reactjs.git
    cd alx-fe-reactjs/tailwind-react-integration
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary Node.js packages.
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

### Environment Variables

This project does not require any specific environment variables for basic operation.

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the project in development mode or build it for production.

1.  **Development Server**:
    To start the development server with hot module replacement, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```
    This will typically open the application at `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port). You can make changes to the source code, and the browser will automatically refresh to reflect them.

2.  **Linting**:
    To check for code quality and style issues, run the linter:
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    # or
    yarn lint
    # or
    pnpm lint
    ```

3.  **Build for Production**:
    To create an optimized production build of your application, run:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    # or
    pnpm build
    ```
    This command will generate static assets in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment.

4.  **Preview Production Build**:
    You can locally preview your production build using Vite's preview server:
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    # or
    yarn preview
    # or
    pnpm preview
    ```
