# React Form Handling Essentials

This project serves as a robust and efficient boilerplate for implementing form handling in modern React applications. Built with Vite, it provides a streamlined development experience, showcasing foundational practices for state management and component interaction within a responsive user interface. It's an excellent starting point for building interactive web forms with React.

## Features

-   **React 19**: Leverages the latest features and improvements for building dynamic user interfaces.
-   **Vite**: Utilizes an incredibly fast build tool that offers instant server start, lightning-fast HMR, and optimized builds.
-   **State Management**: Demonstrates basic component state management using React's `useState` hook.
-   **Modern Development Setup**: Configured with `eslint` for consistent code quality and best practices.
-   **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Enjoy a seamless development experience with instant updates as you make changes to your code.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SireTallest/alx-fe-reactjs.git

    cd alx-fe-reactjs/form-handling-react
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Environment Variables

This project does not currently require any specific environment variables to run.

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This command will:
*   Start the Vite development server.
*   Open the application in your default browser at `http://localhost:5173/` (or another available port).

You can then modify the `src/App.jsx` file to begin implementing your form components and logic. The current setup demonstrates a simple counter to illustrate basic React state management, which can be extended for form inputs.
